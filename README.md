# MusicBrainz

This is a Java Project that I created for a university project during my 4th semester at Harokopio University. The user can search for Music based on the artist name, on the group name, on the release or the country. The Musicbrainz API returns results in json format which are being formatted , so that they will be presentable to the user.


For the creation of the Database please see the file CreateTables.sql
